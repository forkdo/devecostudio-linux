Thanks to [Cris.Q](https://crisq.top/blog/deveco_linux_porting_notes) for the original porting notes that inspired this project.

This is an Arch Linux PKGBUILD that packages DevEco Studio (Huawei's IDE for HarmonyOS development) from its Mac DMG distribution, bringing it to Linux with the help of JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA native launcher and JBR.

It is not an official package. It is not endorsed by Huawei or JetBrains.

## Building

Always check `PKGBUILD` yourself.

For the tested, release-quality version (of PKGBUILD),
use a tagged release — the default branch may carry untested changes:

    git checkout <latest-tag>

(replace `<latest-tag>` with the newest tag, e.g. `26.0.0.621-7` — list
them with `git tag`).

The version in the tag is the `pkgver` in that PKGBUILD — i.e. the DevEco
Studio version you should download below (e.g. `26.0.0.621`).

### Locally with makepkg

You will need to manually download two files from Huawei's website:

1. **DevEco Studio ${pkgver} for Mac**
2. **Command Line Tools for Linux (x86_64) ${pkgver}**

Place both `.zip` files next to the PKGBUILD, **renamed** to the fixed
filenames the PKGBUILD expects — `devecostudio-mac.zip` and
`commandline-tools-linux-x64.zip` (the names are version-independent).
Then:

    makepkg -si

The IntelliJ IDEA tarball is fetched automatically from JetBrains' CDN.

> **Version requirement (hard requirement):** this package works only with
> **DevEco Studio 26.0.0 or newer**. It is not a soft suggestion — older
> releases are unsupported and the build script will not work with them.
>
> Two reasons make this a hard floor:
> 1. **Emulator support.** Versions before 26.0.0 do not support the emulator
>    on this packaging approach at all, which is a core part of what this
>    package provides. Older releases are therefore fundamentally incompatible.
> 2. **Different layout.** Early releases (e.g. `6.1.1`, `5.x`) ship a
>    different file layout — flattened `lib/`, the `skiko-awt-runtime-all`
>    directory, the `tools/dumpParser` Mach-O exclusion, and the IDEA baseline
>    the PKGBUILD pins — that this package does not handle. Using one produces
>    a failed or broken build.
>
> Use a 26.0.0+ Mac DMG and Command Line Tools, or the build will fail.
> If you must use an older DevEco Studio, this package is not for you.

The version in `pkgver` and its SHA256 checksums are what the author tested.
To use a different version:

1. Check the PKGBUILD for the expected filenames (they don't contain a version, so you only rename your downloads once),
2. Download the version you want, rename it to the fixed filenames, then update `pkgver` and the two SHA256 checksums (or set them to `"SKIP"` if you'd rather skip verification),
3. You can also change `_ideaver` for a different IDEA base.

Only the versions in `pkgver` have been tested — if you modify them, test
the result yourself.

### With GitHub Actions

If you don't have an Arch machine at hand, the same build can be run in
GitHub Actions:

1. **Fork** this repository (the workflow is triggered manually), or use your own fork of it.
2. Open the **Actions** tab, select the **Build DevEco Studio PKGBUILD** workflow and click **Run workflow**.
3. Optionally, "Use workflow from" a tagged release.
4. Fill in the two download URLs (Huawei links expire, so you need fresh ones from the [download page](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/deveco-studio/) each time):
   - `mac_zip_url` — URL of the Mac zip
   - `cli_zip_url` — URL of the Linux Command Line Tools zip
5. Optionally override the version and checksums (leave empty to keep the values in `PKGBUILD`):
   - `pkgver` — e.g. `26.0.0.621` (must be 26.0.0 or newer)
   - `mac_zip_sha256` / `cli_zip_sha256` — SHA256 of the two zips; use `SKIP` to skip verification for an untested version
6. When the run finishes, download the `devecostudio-pkg` artifact from the run page and install it locally:

       sudo pacman -U devecostudio-*.pkg.tar.zst

A GitHub account can use Actions for free on public repositories.

### On other distributions

The workflow also produces a distro-agnostic tarball
(`devecostudio-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`) containing the complete
`/opt/devecostudio` tree plus `devecostudio.desktop` at the root. On
Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora or any other Linux, extract it and set up the launcher
manually:

    sudo tar -xzf devecostudio-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -C /opt
    sudo ln -s /opt/devecostudio/bin/devecostudio.sh /usr/local/bin/devecostudio
    sudo desktop-file-install /opt/devecostudio.desktop

You also need the runtime dependencies (package names vary by distro):
`libxss`, `libxtst`, `nss`, `alsa-lib`, `libxcrypt-compat`, `freetype2`,
`libpulse`. Chinese input support needs `fcitx5`. Unlike the Arch package,
the bundled CLI tools are not linked into `/usr/bin` — call them by full
path under `/opt/devecostudio/tools/bin/`.

## CLI tools on PATH

The IDE needs the bundled Huawei command-line tools at runtime, and they
also work standalone from a terminal. By default the package symlinks them
into `/usr/bin`:

| `/usr/bin` entry | Tool | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `devecostudio` | IDE launcher | always installed |
| `hvigorw` | build tool | Huawei-specific name, exposed as-is |
| `ohpm` | package manager | Huawei-specific name, exposed as-is |
| `hstack` | toolchain helper | Huawei-specific name, exposed as-is |
| `hcodelinter` | code linter | prefixed with `h` to avoid collisions |
| `hemulator` | emulator CLI | prefixed with `h` to avoid collisions |

Both behaviors are controlled by variables at the top of the PKGBUILD:

- `_expose_cli_tools=true` — set to `false` to keep the tools out of
  `/usr/bin` entirely (they stay under `/opt/devecostudio/tools/bin/` and
  can still be called by full path).
- `_hprefix_generic_tools=true` — set to `false` to drop the `h` prefix
  and expose `codelinter` / `Emulator` under their original names (which
  may collide with other packages).

## Emulator

The emulator works, but before first use you must accept the software
agreements and
download the system images. For example:

    # List available images
    hemulator -imageList

    # Phone images only
    hemulator -imageList -deviceType phone

    # Use jq for a concise list
    hemulator -imageList -deviceType phone | jq '.[].osVersion'

    # Install an image
    hemulator -install -deviceType phone -osVersion "HarmonyOS 6.1.1(24)"

Once installed, you can create, manage and start emulators from the
IDE's Device Manager.

## Previewer

The previewer is unavailable. Huawei has not yet ported the Rosen
rendering engine to Linux.

## What happens under the hood

The PKGBUILD extracts the Mac DMG and takes the platform-independent parts
— JARs, plugins, modules. The SDK and CLI tools (hvigor, ohpm, node,
emulator, …) come from Huawei's Linux Command Line Tools instead. Then the
macOS-specific bits (launcher, JBR, native libraries) are replaced with
their Linux counterparts from IntelliJ IDEA. The vmoptions and
product-info.json are transformed on the fly so the IDE knows it's running
on Linux.

The result is a native-feeling DevEco Studio that runs without Wine or
containers.

Why repackage from the Mac version? Huawei distributes DevEco Studio for
Windows, macOS, and Linux. The Linux distribution has two problems: the
installer is an `.exe` that is hard to extract, and the packaged version
lags behind in updates. The Mac DMG is trivially extractable and contains
all the cross-platform files we need.

The only truly platform-specific things we swap out are:
- The Java runtime (JBR) — macOS → Linux
- The native launcher binary (and `fsnotifier`)
- Shared libraries (.so files)
- The SDK and CLI tools — taken from the Linux Command Line Tools

Everything else — the Java code, plugins, templates — is
platform-independent.

### The emulator

Three emulator-related quirks deserve a mention.

First, Huawei's code only
distinguishes Mac from non-Mac, and the non-Mac branch hardcodes the
`Emulator.exe` filename. On Linux that file does not exist, which broke the
Device Manager and debugging. The package fixes this with a symlink:
`Emulator.exe -> Emulator` in `tools/emulator/`.

Second, system images must be downloaded manually because of how the
official installer works: when the emulator is missing, its wizard downloads
the binary *and* the system image together. Since this package bundles the
binary, the IDE thinks the emulator is installed and never offers the
wizard, leaving the system image as the only missing piece — see the
Emulator section above for how to get one.

Third, the emulator's software agreements: the IDE launches the emulator
binary directly, and if the agreements were never accepted it waits
silently for a `y`. The `Emulator` wrapper auto-accepts them on first use
(`hemulator ...` when `~/Library/Caches/Huawei/Emulator26.0/.emu_config`
does not exist runs `-license accept` and exits), so by the time you use
the IDE the agreements are in place. To opt out of the auto-accept,
truncate that `.emu_config` file.

### Wayland

Most of the IDE runs fine under Wayland, but the CEF-based user interfaces
— the project structure dialog, markdown preview, and similar — crash their
GPU process under Wayland (`eglCreateWindowSurface` segfault). The launcher
wrapper works around this by forcing the X11 backend by default
(`unset WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `GDK_BACKEND=x11`), which makes every CEF page
render correctly through XWayland.

If you prefer to run under Wayland natively, set
`DEVECO_DISABLE_X11_WORKAROUND=1` before launching — but expect the CEF
pages to be blank or broken.

The launcher also enables JCEF's headless + out-of-process rendering by
default (equivalent to `ide.browser.jcef.headless.enabled` and
`ide.browser.jcef.out-of-process.enabled` in the registry), which fixes
blank CEF pages in some environments. Set `DEVECO_DISABLE_JCEF_HEADLESS=1`
before launching to opt out.

### HiDPI

XWayland does not report per-monitor scale to the JVM (it reports 1.0), so
on a HiDPI screen the IDE would lock its UI scale to 1.0 — too small. The
launcher reads the compositor's real scale (`wlr-randr`), rounds it to the
nearest quarter step, and injects it as `-Dide.ui.scale` via a user
vmoptions overlay.

Override the value or disable the detection:

    DEVECO_UI_SCALE=1.2 devecostudio   # use 1.2 as-is
    DEVECO_UI_SCALE=off devecostudio   # leave scaling to the JVM

You can also set the scale manually via the IDE's *Help → Edit Custom VM
Options*. For more, see [the IDEA HiDPI
documentation](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007994999-HiDPI-configuration).

### Some magic

For the sake of brevity, you can check [DETAILS.md](DETAILS.md) to learn about other magic used in this project.

## License situation

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Huawei.

DevEco Studio is a commercial product owned by Huawei. Before using it, you agree to the HUAWEI DevEco Studio User Agreement (reproduced in LICENSE.huawei). A few clauses worth noting:

- **Clause 1.6** grants a "limited, non-exclusive, free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable" license to use DevEco Studio solely for developing applications that run on OpenHarmony-compatible devices and/or HarmonyOS.
- **Clause 1.7(f)** prohibits copying or modifying the service, or merging any part of it with other programs.
- **Clause 1.7(h)** prohibits reverse engineering, decompiling, or creating derivative works.
- **Clause 1.7(i)** prohibits distributing, selling, or transferring the service.

This packaging project extracts platform-independent files from the Mac DMG and recombines them with Linux-native components (launcher, JBR, native libraries) from IntelliJ IDEA. The Java bytecode and resources are not modified, but configuration files are transformed. This likely constitutes "modification" and "merging" under clauses 1.7(f) and 1.7(h).

What this means in practice:
- Building this package for personal use is what the author does, and the project exists to document that process.
- Distributing the resulting package to others is likely not permitted under Huawei's terms.
- If you have legal concerns, consult Huawei's official licensing at https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/deveco-studio/ and your own legal counsel.

### Licensing of the packaging scripts

The files that make up this packaging project are provided under the BSD 2-Clause license.

They are not part of DevEco Studio and carry no restrictions from Huawei's terms.

### Licensing of bundled components

- DevEco Studio itself and its plugins are proprietary works of Huawei.
- JetBrains Runtime (JBR) is GPLv2 with the classpath exception, based on OpenJDK.
- IntelliJ IDEA Community components are available under Apache 2.0.
- Various third-party libraries bundled with DevEco Studio carry their own licenses.
